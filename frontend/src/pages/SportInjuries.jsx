        treatment and prevention of disorders of the musculoskeletal system. It
        includes bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves.

        variety of methods to diagnose and treat musculoskeletal conditions,
        including physical examinations, imaging tests (such as x-rays and MRIs)
        and surgical procedures. They also recommend non-surgical treatment
        options such as physical therapy, medication and lifestyle changes to
        help patients manage their conditions and improve their mobility and
