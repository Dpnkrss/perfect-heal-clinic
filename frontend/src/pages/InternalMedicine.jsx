        Internal Medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with diagnosis,
        treatment, and primary care for all common and rare diseases that
        generally affect the adult population. We deliver effective treatments
        for common and rare diseases and guide individuals through the process
        of recovery and healing. In a general sense, it can be understood as
        “primary care for adults”. Sometimes specializations cannot cater to
        diseases and conditions that affect your multi-system functions or are
        directly linked to certain life disorders and conditions. Conditions
        like obesity, diabetes, and tension require comprehensive and holistic
        treatments that treat the impact it has on life and the way it tends to
        affect your health and body. A specialist in internal medicine will help
        you recover and cure the diseases or conditions that affect your body.
        Often, they will collaborate with other specialists and doctors and
        perform certain diagnostic procedures to treat your condition more
        effectively. Conditions treated under Internal Medicine Department
        include: Fever (Pyrexia) Chronic cough Asthma COPD (including
        bronchitis, seasonal rhinitis, and allergies) Tuberculosis Thyroid
        disorders Hypertension Dyspepsia Hepatitis Diabetes Migraine Urinary
